Read this to know my awesome idiotic thoughts on this amazing cruel world...


  I am a 90's Kid. Now came out of the teenager cocoon recently. But I couldn't able to spread my wings into this exquisite world. 
Being pulled by certain weights of relationship, I realized it's important to find a way to fly with those weights in my pant pockets.

  In search of that "WAY", I had many sleepless nights.
